### What is HTML?
the acrnym HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, the authorizing language used to create pages on the world wide web(www). HTML is a set of codes or HTML tags that provide a web browser with directions on how to structure a web page's information and features.
  
### Write HTML5 Using Notepad or TextEdit
 Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML5 Editors. However for learning HTML5 we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad(PC) or TextEdit(Mac). We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML5. 
 
 Follow four steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit
 
### Step 1&#58; Open NotePad(PC)
 **Windows 8 or later&#58;**
 
 Open Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type **Notepad**.
 
 **Windows 7 or Earlier&#58;**
 
 Open **Start** > **Programs** > **Accessories** > **Notepad**
 
### Step 1&#58; Open NotePad(Mac)
Open **Finder** > **Applications** > **TextEdit**

Also Change some preferences to get the application save files correctly. In **Preferences** > **Format** choose **"Plain Text"** , then under "Open and Save", Check the box that says "Ignore rich text commands in HTML files". **Then open a new document to place the code**

### Step 2&#58; Write Some Html
Write or Copy some HTML into NotePad.

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>

</html>

{% endhighlight %}

![]({{ "/images/notepad-web.png" }})

### Step 3&#58; Save The HTML5 Page
Save the file on your computer. Select **File**  > **Save As** in the Notepad menu.
Name the file **index.html** and set the encoding to **UTF-8** (which is the prefered encoding for HTML5 files).

![]({{ "/images/notepad-save.png" }})

**You can either use .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference, it is up to you**

### Step 4&#58; View the HTML5 Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

The result will look much like this&#58;

![]({{ "/images/browser-view.png" }})
