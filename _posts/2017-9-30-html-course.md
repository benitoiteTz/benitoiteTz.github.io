title: Tutorial&#58; Safari Tour Tanzania
---

The grand plan of this tutorial is to build a website(Safari Website) that helps tourists comming to/from Tanzania find best national parks and game reserves available in Tanzania

Safari Tour website covers core fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3. You will build a basic website that has many of the features you'd expect to find in a full-blown website: Home page with summary of everything about safari, National parks page showing all national parks found in Tanzania, Game reserves page showing a list of all gamereserves found in Tanzania and a contact us page for contacting people organising safari.

You'll learn enough core HTML5 and CSS3 to get started and gain confidance to build websites. You'll find many links to pages with greater depth.

When you're done with this tutorial the website will look like this [Safari Tour](https://safari.neocities.org/)
