title: Tutorial Safari Tour Tanzania
---

The grand plan of this tutorial is to build a website(Safari Website) that helps tourists comming to/from Tanzania find best national parks and game reserves available in Tanzania

Safari Tour website covers core fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3. You will build a basic website that has many of the features you'd expect to find in a full-blown website: Home page with summary of everything about safari, National parks page showing all national parks found in Tanzania, Game reserves page showing a list of all gamereserves found in Tanzania and a contact us page for contacting people organising safari.
